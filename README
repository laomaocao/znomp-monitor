module:
redis: reuse znomp redis database
collector: get worker status from znomp api every INTERNAL seconds,store in coin:workeraddress(minername:hashrate string)
front: show woker status by order group by worker address,generate html table 
webserver: httpd daemon, generate html head and tail


#about the database
The data in redis is processed & stored in memory , I think it is more efficient than mysql innodb engine
All keys is stored in redis db 0 which znomp is in use. The reason of select the same db is that I must maintain 2 redis client handles if want to manipulate keys in db 0 and db 1.Forgive my laziness

The following key is generated by znomp/libs/sharePorcessor.js .It is different from origin version at line 86.When a share is submit by a miner, store the miner address and timestamp
	key	$COIN:workerlist
	type 	hash
	member 	$ADDRESS.$MINER_NAME
	value	timestamp (million second)

The following key is generated by module collector.It gets json result from znomp api/stats every 30 seconds.By default , znomp refresh pool stat in every 30 seconds. So collector choose the same frequency. When there is a GPU offline , the miner hash rate will be reduced . Zset can list the hashrate in order,it  will be very helpful to find the smallest one.Suppose all miners have the same hash power.
	key $COIN:$ADDRESS
	type orderd zset
	member	miner name(address is no included,it is shorter and enough )
	value	hashrate string(It is generated by znomp )
